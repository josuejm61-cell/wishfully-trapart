        <h1>This is a screenshot of Apple’s homepage that I modified using Chrome Dev Tools. I changed the color of the letters green, made the background color violet purple, and replaced the text with a personalized message.</h1>
        <p>
            I used browser developer tools to temporarily "vandalize" a
            website. Below is a screenshot showing my changes. These edits
            only appeared on my computer and did not affect the actual
            website.
        </p>
        <div class="screenshot-container">
            <!-- 
                IMPORTANT: Update the src attribute below to match your screenshot filename.
                Example: If your screenshot is named "apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png", change the line to:
                src="./apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png"
            -->
            <img src="apple-dot-com-but-with-color.png"

        <h2>What I "Vandalized"</h2>
        <p>
            Describe the changes you made to the website using the browser's developer tools. Some potential questions
            to consider:
        <ul>
            <li>What text did you edit? I added " Everything Josh likes. He will buy every iPhone any time." </li>
            <li>What CSS properties did you modify? I modified the font color and the background.</li>
            <li>What made your edits interesting or amusing? It was really fun to modify it and have fun with it. </li>
            <li>Did you understand why some changes worked and some didn't? Yes I did notice somethings did not changed. </li>
            <li>Why did you choose the changes you did? I thought it be fun to see my favorite brand and my vandalism.</li>
            <li>Were you able to understand how the HTML and CSS worked together to make the changes you made? Yes I understood.</li>
            <li>Do you think you have a better sense of how dev tools can be used while crafting your own webpages? Defenetily will be fun to design our own website.</li>
        </ul>
