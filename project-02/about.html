    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
    Hi, I’m Josue J. Mondragon. I’m a bilingual banking professional with nearly a decade of experience in customer service, financial operations, and client support. In my role as an Associate Banker at JPMorgan Chase, I focus on helping clients reach their financial goals by providing clear guidance, personalized solutions, and dependable service.
Before entering the banking industry, I gained extensive leadership and operations experience as a Certified Swing Manager at McDonald’s, where I led teams, improved service processes, and ensured smooth daily operations. That experience shaped the way I approach teamwork, communication, and customer care today.
I’m currently working toward my bachelor’s degree at Texas Tech University, and I’ve also volunteered in educational settings—supporting classrooms, teaching financial literacy, and engaging young students in learning. Being fluent in both English and Spanish allows me to connect with a wide range of people, and I’m passionate about making a positive impact in my community and in every role I take on.
